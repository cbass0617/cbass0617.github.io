            <p style="text-align:left;">Hello there and thanks for visiting our website! Laveen Pet Rescue and Supply is the brainchild of Nextdoor app members here in Laveen coming up with a solution to the sudden growth of our small town. With this growth came an influx of stray pets and the local Veterinarian overwhelmed. <br> Thanks to Laveen resident Àntreigh Preñure, the business broke ground in late 2019 and has to date, rescued and re-homed over 600 dogs, cats, birds and reptiles in that time. Come on in and see if your best friend is waiting for you!</p>
